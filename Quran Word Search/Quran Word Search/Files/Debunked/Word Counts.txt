Remarks:
	-There are lots of websites out there that claim to have found certain mathematical "miracles" in the Quran, usually by finding anything, no matter how small, to support their side and invalidating the other, and so things that are insignificant can be interpreted to be significant. There are even certain cases of conflicting evidence, as both sometimes decide to fabricate and/or omit relevant information. In the 1974, an Eygptian living in the United States named Rashad Khalifa published research on the number 19, with the purpose of exposing the Quran's supposed accuracy with this number. It was originally recieved favorably, but then he claimed Prophethood based on his research (an act considered a lie or heresy by Islamic scripture, as it explicitly states that Muhammad is the last prophet and that the Quran is our ultimate guide for all people in all time) and people accused him of faking most of it, and as such people started having negative attitudes to the supposed numerical miracles of the Quran. However, this paper will not address the validity of Khalifa's work, rather the focus of this paper is to expose the inaccuracies made by those for and against the mathematical "miracles" in the Quran. I will not have any explanations here, just the facts; to see the individual word counts and how I was able to get that information, see "Significant Word Counts.txt". If the Quran is indeed the word of God, exposing the inaccuracies should shed some light on a much greater or more accurate "miracle".
