Given the amount of coincidences the Quran has with its numerical and scientific precision, it can be safely concluded that the Quran was written intentionally, as it is highly improbable to the highest extreme that the Quran has all these coincidences randomly.

However, now a new question arises: who actually wrote the Quran?

Muhammad is the first suspect, given that he is historically and religiously credited with delivering the Quran. Let's look at how he received and organized the Quran:
	
	-The recieved his "revelations" seven different ways, dependent on the different dialects of the Arabs. In other words, by the end of his prophethood, he had 7 different ways to say the Quran memorized.
	-He sometimes recieved "revelation" dependent on the situation he was in, and other times randomly.
	-When he received the "revelations", he would experience some sort of seizure, sometimes painful, and he would memorize it and deliver it to his companions.
	-In his 23 years of prophethood, he received a lot of verses, but up to this point he knew them in chronological order. The Quran we have now is not, and so we know at the end of his prophethood he organized the verses in the order we have today. This reorganization happened overnight*, supposedly with the help of angel Gabriel.
	-After his death, there were two "organizations" of the Quran. The first happened about a year after his death when there was some disagreement on what the Quran says because of the different dialects, so the only dialect used after that was the Qurayshi one, given that the Quraysh was the biggest tribe and the most well versed in Arabic. The second "organization" happened about 19 years after the Prophet's death, when there were disagreements on the diacritics and pronunciation. As a result, the committee of scribes added numerical verse numbers and finalized the diacritics. In short, the Quran got its numbers 19 years after the Prophet's death.
	-Since then, the Quran has not been changed in any way, as provided by historical evidence and the fact that it is easy to memorize.


Looking at the way the Quran was revealed, Muhammad could have been its author only if he possessed certain qualities (or he simply was the luckiest person to have ever existed on the face of the earth):

	-The Prophet was an orphan, and so he was raised as a merchant by his uncle. However, the kinds of revelations he recieved was in the highest levels of Arabic, so there was no way he could have written this on his own. However, the only way he could have organized the Quran with all the mathematical accuracies in mind is only if he had written or memorized all Quranic verses prior to his prophethood as well as organized them in the current state that we have it, and waited until a certain event happened in his life to "reveal" it. However, this implies that he had the Quran completed by the age of 40, which means he had to have accurately predicted many future events (as some verses in the Quran directly address events during the Prophet's life).
	-He was a mathematical prodigy, given the amount of mathematical symmetries that exist in the Quran.
	-He had an uncanny knowledge of true science at his time, enough to rival or even surpass Einstein or any other scientific figure.
	-He would have had several exchanges with learned people to get the required mathematical and scientific knowledge, which implies that these learned people also had an uncanny knowledge of the truth in the world.

These ideas are technically possible, however there are some issues that need to be addressed. These are some that exist, but are in no way limited to:

	-His life as a merchant may have granted him opportunities to meet with these learned people, however this implies that he consistently met with them (given the complexity of the knowledge and grammar used in the Quran), something that seems lost to history and something that his enemies would have definetly used against him, and during his time as a merchant he was extremely busy. The only way for him to have consistenly met with them is if Abu Talib (his uncle) had contacts with these learned people and secretly taught Muhammad everything under the facade of being a merchant even until the age of 40. The issue with that is that he never beleived in Muhammad's teachings, he merely loved him and protected him from the enemies of his tribe.
	-There was a point in his life where his wift Aisha was accused of cheating on him. Yet there was a long period of time (about a month*) before the revelation came to declare her innocence and warn of gossiping. During this time, Aisha and Muhammad were not on speaking terms, and lived in separate houses. It has been shown in several hadiths that the Prophet loved his wives dearly, so, as the author of the Quran, why would he wait a month to declare her innocence?
	-Why did Muhammad never speak of the mathematical properties of the Quran, if it could've been used to support his cause even more? How did he know, if he did at all, that there would come a time where there would be sufficient technology to decode the Quran's math?
	-The count for "moon" in the Quran is 27, which is the number of days it takes for the moon to complete one orbit around the Earth. However, the moon's phases take 29.5 days, which is how the Islamic lunar year is counted. Why didn't he make the count for "moon" 29 or 30? And how would he ever have known about the 27-day orbit? This would have required him to know many things about the Earth's orientation in the solar system as well as the orientation of the moon in proportion to the Earth, which requires technology that far exceeds what they had at the time. Furthermore, the moon's diameter is about 27% of the Earth's. If he had this in mind, how would he have even thought to know this?
	-The Quran predicted that the Roman empire would fall despite their power, and return to power after a couple of years, which indeed happen after the revelation of this verse by a couple years. Furthermore, the Quran states that this will happen in the "lowest point", and coincidentally the Byzantium army was defeated by the Persians at the Dead Sea, which happens to be the lowest land point on the Earth. Muhammad would have needed to know this before so boldly predicting the fall and rise of the Romans or risk being found as a fraud, so why would he even put himself in that position if he did not have the ability to see into the future?
	-If Muhammad had a malicious intent with authoring the Quran and tricking his followers into believing him, why didn't accept any opportunity to grow wealthy or socially powerful? He always kept himself living in a humble state, and people always offered him better living spaces and in general a better condition of living, yet he would never accept.
	-Hadiths are people reporting the words of the Prophet. If Muhammad was the author of the Quran, how come the way he speaks in the hadith does not match the way he supposedly wrote in the Quran? Furthermore, if Muhammad had the Quran finished by the age of 40, where did he get the time to be taught the highest form of Arabic when he was originally illiterate?
	


These issues also exist with anyone to have existed at the time, even with the most literate and with the most "scientific" knowledge. Given the technology needed to understand these kinds of knowledge, it can be safely concluded that no one at the time of the Prophet  could have wrote the Quran with all the mathematical, scientific, grammatical, and historical evidence that exist.


Where's the next step? As for the conclusions we have so far, here is what is required for the Quran to be authored by a human:

	-Having such a high level of understanding of the Arabic language to the point of being able to use incorrect grammar to make a stronger point.
	-Having access to technology to quickly arrange Arabic words into patterns without changing previous words and verses, and the ability to keep doing so despite new additional words or verses (currently something beyond our current technologies).
	-Having written the Quran in such a way that despite differences in eras, the Quranic verses would have just the right combination of precision and abiguity so that it could confirm the "sciences" of any era, including the Prophet's and ours.
	-Having mulitudes of accurate predictions, or the ability to see in the future, or the ability to repeatedly travel in time.


Given the above conditions, the only way Muhammad, or anyone else in that time for that matter, could have authored the Quran is if they were the luckiest group of people to have ever existed. The chances of this are practically zero, given the amount of evidence in the mathematics field alone, let alone scientifical, linguistic, or historical, and so this isn't a practical idea. However, looking at the above conditions, there has never been a human with all these abilities to have ever exist, even with the technology we have now. So how to we logically continue this discussion?

Given that we can't find an answer to who authored the Quran, let's change gears and look at what the author is actually saying. All over the Quran, the main point is for mankind to serve our Lord in the best way that we can and that everything we know in this world is a fabricaton from God. Given the amount of mathematical and scientific evidence shown in the Quran, the last option we have is to trust the author, as there is nothing in this world that can show that a human is the author of the Quran.

-------------------------------------------

Ther results from the above discussion provides our options for how to percieve the Quran:

	1. Believe in extreme luck, and believe that Muhammad is the literal luckiest person to have ever existed, so lucky that no one has ever approached the tier he's on.
	
	2. Believe in some future science or some sort of irrational or far-fetched (otherwise known as baseless) idea to support what you think exists, just to support your current worldview and beliefs (i.e. the Flat Earth Society).
	
	3. Believe in the Islamic god, the angels, the books (Bible included), the Day of Judgement, the prophets, and that Muhammad is His final messsenger (does not necessarily mean you have to do all the actions required in Islam; this discussion is merely about whether the Quran is valid or not).
	
	4. Not care whatsoever; you don't have to care about anything about what the Quran says or about what might happen in the next life.


In the end, despite differences in beliefs, we still have the free will to decide for ourselves what to believe in. However, despite differences in beliefs, it can be stated with such a certainty that the author of the Quran can only be some form of higher intelligence, and Muslims believe this intelligence to be the god mentioned in the Quran. In the end, even if Islam is right, everyone gets to decide for themselves what they want to do with their lives. However, everyone must be prepared to make a choice (even if the choice is not making one), because with each choice comes an invisible End User License Agreement, and regardless of whether we want to or not, we have to accept the risks and responsibilities that come with our choices.
