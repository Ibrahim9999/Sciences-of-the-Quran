-In every single "miracle" they try to debunk they criticize "apologists" for the counting of words with prefixes to get the significant numbers, and the significant numbers are only able to be achieved if the prefixes are consistently included. This shows that there is a consistent and clear pattern in the exposing of these numbers, which the authors do not seem to acknowledge.

-Sometimes, the authors will criticize the separation of word counts into specific conjugations, and other times they will criticize not doing so. If anything, this shows that there are two different ways to get the "miraculous" numbers, and both ways are consistently used, as seen by the authors' consistency in pointing them out.

-Sometimes, there's incorrect grammar in the Quran regarding word conjugations, such as a singular word being used as plural (because of the other words, ex. "so 70 man went to town"). In every case, the meaning is much more powerful in arabic because of this grammer switch. Every time a word count includes one of these kinds of words, the authors will criticize "apologists" or the Quran for this difference. Yet every single time a "miraculous" count is found, the gramatically incorrect form of the word is counted. This is a consistent pattern, yet the authors disregard it due to their idea of what valid pattern should look like.

-There are diacritics in arabic, which are marks made on arabic letters to change how they sound. If the letters are the same in two words but the diacritics are different, the meaning can be changed entirely. When words like these appear in the calculation of the "miraculous" word counts, the authors criticize the effort required to get past this discrepancy, calling the word counts "questionable".


Conclusion:
	-The authors are looking for one thing only, which is the count of an arabic word without any differences in prefixes, conjugations, or otherwise, and that count has to be in relation to its meaning. Anything other than this, they will immediately consider it to be false and "apologetic". This is the main purpose of WikiIslam, and this (so far) is not how the "miraculous" numbers keep being found. They are technically right, given their views, but they discredit how the "miraculous" numbers are found PURELY on the fact that it is not significant in their perspective, not because of a lack of a consistent pattern.
