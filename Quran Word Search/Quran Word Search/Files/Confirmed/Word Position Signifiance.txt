1. Position of "The Bee"
	-The chapter titled "The Bee" is the 16th chapter in the Quran
	
	-Potential Significance:
		-Male bees have 16 chromosomes. Interestingly, the 16th chapter in the Quran is titled "The Bee", more specifically "The [male] Bee", as the conjugation for "bee" used in the title is in masculine form.
		-There is only one verse in the 16th chapter ("The Bee") where a bee is addressed, which is verse 68. This verse has 16 words (including the "waw", which means "and" in arabic). Furthermore, even though the conjugation of "bee" is masculine, all of its attributes mentioned in the next two verses are feminine, which means the bee mentioned is female. Verses 68 and 69 state, "And thy Lord inspired the bee saying: take thou for thyself of the mountains houses and of the trees and of that which they erect. (68) Then eat thou of all the fruits and tread the ways of thy Lord made easy. There springeth forth from their [singular] bellies a drink varied in colours; therein is healing for mankind; verily therein is a sign for a people who reflect." Coincidentally, all worker bees are female, and are responsible for everything the Quran mentions in these verses (the male's only job is to mate with the queen). Not only that, but bees make honey through a second stomach specifically designed for processing honey (known as the "crop"), and the Quran explicitly states that bees [specifically the female] has multiple bellies. Worker bees are also responsible for making hives, and true to the Quran's words, do not only make hives out of wax, but also in mountains and trees.

		-There are 32 occurances of "Allah" before the 68th verse (not including the basmallah), which is the same number of chromosomes in a female bee (32 is also 16 * 2).

		-There are 128 verses in chapter 16 ("The Bee"), which is divisible by both 16 and 32 (16*8 and 32*4).
		-Verse 68 is when "bee" is mentioned, and contains 13 words (not including the "waw", which means "and"). Starting at the beginning of the chapter and ending before this verse, there are 884 words and 3727 letters. Coincidentally, 68*13 equals 884, and 3727** is a prime number. Furthermore, starting from the beginning of the chapter and ending after the only occurance of "bee", there are 888 words and 3743 letters. 3743* is divisible by 19. Also, starting from the beginning of verse 68 and ending on the occurance of "bee", there are 16 letters. In addition, starting from the beginning of the Quran to the beginning of chapter 16 ("The Bee"), there are 144343 letters (including the basmallahs - 144077 without). Interestingly, both 144343* and 144077* are divisible by 19 (19*7597, 19*7583). 7583 is also a prime number.
