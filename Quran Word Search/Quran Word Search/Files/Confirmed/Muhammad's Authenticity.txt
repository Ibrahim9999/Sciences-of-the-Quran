People who saw revelations come to Muhammad say that he recieved spasms similar to epileptic seizures.

Narrated Safwan bin Ya’la bin Umaiya: Ya’la used to say, “I wish I could see Allah’s Apostle at the time he is being inspired Divinely.” When the Prophet was at Al-Ja’rana and was shaded by a garment hanging over him and some of his companions were with him, a man perfumed with scent came and said, “O Allah’s Apostle! What is your opinion regarding a man who assumes Ihram and puts on a cloak after perfuming his body with scent?” The Prophet waited for a while, and then the Divine Inspiration descended upon him. ‘Umar pointed out to Ya’la, telling him to come. Ya’la came and pushed his head (underneath the screen which was covering the Prophet ) and behold! The Prophet’s face was red and he kept on breathing heavily for a while and then he was relieved. Thereupon he said, “Where is the questioner who asked me about ‘Umra a while ago?” The man was sought and then was brought before the Prophet who said (to him), “As regards the scent which you perfumed your body with, you must wash it off thrice, and as for your cloak, you must take it off; and then perform in your ‘Umra all those things which you perform in Hajj.” [Sahih Bukhari, Volume 6, Book 61, Number 508]

This revelations happened over a period of 23 years, from age 40 to 60. This spurs the question that is on every curious mind: could Muhammad have produced the Quran from his own thoughts? If Allah is so great and powerful, why did he make his Prophet suffer? Is the Quran really divine as it claims, or is it another ploy made by an immoral person to gain power?

Comparing Muhammad to the Quran:

-Sometimes the revelations came to him privately, and sometimes publicly
-Muhammad's speech in the Hadith do not match the way the Quran is written; he speaks in a much simpler tone
-Muhammad was known by his friends, community, and even his enemies as always truthful
-Muhammad never took credit for himself for revealing the Quran, he always mentioned God
-The Quran commands Muslims to hold all of the Prophets in equally high regard (Quran 2:136)
-The Quran went against the deep customs and norms of the Arabs at the time, effectively putting Muhammad's life at risk (there were indeed several attempts to end his life), and quite often did his messages increase the hardships in his life
-The Quran's time of revelation did not quite conform to when Muhammad would have preferred it: one of the wives of the Prophet was once accused of cheating on him, and there was no evidence to suggest against it. It took one month after the incident for a revelation to come to him, declaring her innocence (Quran 24:11-25).
-There is one chapter in the Quran that was sent down as a reproachment for Muhammad when he prioritized a meeting with his tribe's leaders over a blind man looking for information about Islam. Furthermore, in most times Muhammad is mentioned in the Quran, he is referred to as scared or helpless in the face of difficulty, and is reproached for not doing something he could have done (Quran 66:1, 33:43, 9:113, chapter 80, 
-He spent his life as a prophet spreading the word of Islam and supposedly administering justice in the land. Theoretically, he would not have had he time to think about the higher order grammer and vocabulary of the Quran, especially since he was raised by his merchant uncle and not in literacy, also since never once did an enemy find him to be a liar.
-Muhammad is mentioned very little in the Quran, in fact both Moses and Jesus appear more times than he is.
-There is at least some basic mathematical structure of the way the Quran is written. For instance, the singular word for "day" is mentioned 365 times, the plural 30 times, the singular word for "month" 12 times, angels and devils are mentioned the exact number of times, etc. Muhammad never decided to mention this, even though it would have provided more authenticity to his revelations at the time.
-He never asked money for his revelations, nor did he ever request people to worship him
-Up to this day, the Quran remains unchanged, as supported by archeology
-The Quran prophesizes some things that end up being accurate: for instance, Quran 10:92 says that God will preserve the Pharoh's body to be a sign for the people after Moses, and in 1898 archeologists discovered the dead body of Ramses II floating in the Read Sea, the same sea that Moses supposedly crossed with the people of Israel.
-The Quran provides an opportunity for skeptics to come up with a better book than the Quran
-The Quran favors the righteous non-believers overe non-righteous Muslims (Quran 4:105-113)

------------------------------------------------------------

Looking at the information above, it would seem very unlikely that he came up with the Quran on his own. However, there is still the possibility that he did, or at least got help from others, or by some miracle he thought of the Quran randomly (which would effecively make Muhammad the literal luckiest person to have ever lived, given the complexity of the Quran and how he lived his life). So now the question changes: would would it take to prove that Muhammad is not the author of the Quran?

We obviously can't see in other people's minds, let alone people who have already passed. We will never know exactly what went through Muhammad's head, maybe unless we found a way to clone him and had mind-reading technology. The next best thing would be his community, and to see what they had to say about him. Everyone, including his enemies, before and after the time of his Prophethood, regarded him as trustworthy. His ability to lie was never a tactic used by the enemy to discredit him. However, there is still again the possibility that he changed and started lying to the people about the source of his revelation. How can we know for sure? The next best thing, arguably the best thing, is to look at the authenticity of the Quran.

For us to answer that question, we would need to find undeniable proof that the Quran is written by a superhuman intelligence. With the above information, we can see that some people claim the Quran has some sort of mathematical ans scientific accuracy. It seems like therin lies the answer to our question:

If we were to know whether Islam is the true religion, we would need to know how authentic Muhammad's revelations are. We know these revelations as the Quran. To know whether if the Quran is the truth or not, we would need undeniable proof that it could not have been produced by a human. For this to be true, there would need to be some sort of knowledge or idea that exists in the modern Quran that could not have been produced at the time of Muhammad, maybe even in today's time. Things that would fall under this category include:
	-Facts that are confirmed by modern science that was considered false at the time of Muhammad (this shows that regardless of what Muhammad knew, whether it is right or wrong, the author of the Quran has the correct knowledge of how the world works)
	-Predictions about the future that end up being true (this shows that the Quran is either extremely lucky or there is something more going on)
	-A superhuman pattern in the way the Quran was written (indicates that Muhammad could not have written the Quran with its impeccable accuracy even if he tried; this also would show that the Quran is actually unchanged, given that any change made to the quran would invalidate the supposed pattern)
